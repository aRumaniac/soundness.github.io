INTRODUCTION
What:
- Soundness Of Mind as the name suggest it is about mental Health, which is not consider 
as important. The Soundness of Mind will be a website which will target mentally 
disturbed. The website will offer different measures to them through various 
functionality such as volunteering and stress relieving games. 
Why:
- It is given that we live in a taboo society and issues like mental stability is considered 
buzzword. Mental health is important aspect of our life. Mental health includes our 
emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
Ultimately affecting our sole existence. There are many factors contributing to the 
mental health problems. It is common specially among students and people can get 
better using various methods.
How:
- For this project I will be consulting some psychologist blog, you tube channel like the 
counselling channel, mental health with Sonali, and other, articles and therapy 
procedures. As for the functionality that the website will be offering for distraction and 
help, I will consider contacting volunteering center, animals’ shelter and for the 
relaxing. I will go with online game available and will go through all the relaxing 
medication and calming song available for my work. Talking suggestion and awaking
people, I will contact NGOs for their help.
Importance:
- Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. For 
example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, 
particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, 
the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.

Existing work:
- Though there are several organizations for this purpose but the one that impressed me 
in “PINE REST - https://www.pinerest.org/”. They have variety of program and 
consultant for the victims. Like mother and baby, mood disorders, addiction treatment, 
internship program and so on. But it appears to me that they offer offline treatment 
mainly and there is not much activities to help them.

  GOALS
- Mental health counsellors work with individuals, families and communities to deal 
with issues pertaining to behaviour, cognition and emotions. Broadly speaking this
project will asses mental and emotional health. This will provide guidance and 
support to its users during challenging times with issues related to mental illness such 
as anxiety, stress and depression. The purpose is to bring positive changes. Objectives 
are different for each individual, depending on the issue and its severity. Other goas 
are to reduce stigma associated with mental illness, promote help seeking behaviours
and emotional well-being practices, and prevent suicide through individual education 
and outreach events.

TOOLS USED
- For the development purpose I will be using following tools:
➢ Figma: - UI 
- Figma is like craft free hand and multiple people can collaborate on a single project. It 
is easy to handle and has its own web browser as well as native apps.
➢ React Js: - Frontend
- Beside being fast and simple, react offer to have reusable component and change data 
without reloading page.
➢ Node Js: - Backend
- Node Js can handle multiple requests easily and can be use for backend-api.
➢ MongoDB: - Database
- MongoDB is simple, dynamic, object-oriented and has no complex joins. It uses 
document-based queries which is convenient

PROPOSED DESIGN
- Home: What, why and how it works
- About mental illness: details and facts
- Support and education: help and how we support
- Donations
- Campings
- Activities
- Consultation

  SIGNIFICANCE
- Creating awareness is a difficult task. When there is awareness about mental health it 
eases identification and early treatment for these individuals.
Early intervention can help our loved one receive appropriate care. As a result, 
recovery is faster. It also eliminates stigma for these people. It can also create new 
improvements for the mentally ill. As there is more demand from the public, it can 
produce a flow of attention. This attention can eventually result in great changes for 
the mentally ill. It can lead to improvements on policy, research, and service 
development
